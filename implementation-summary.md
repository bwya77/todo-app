# Sidebar Toggle Button Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Feature Overview
Enhanced the sidebar toggle button in the todo-app with hover and click effects:
- Light grey rounded square background on hover
- Slightly darker background when clicked
- Smooth transitions between states

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **ContentView.swift**
   - Created a custom `SidebarToggleButton` SwiftUI view
   - Implemented hover and click detection with state tracking
   - Replaced NSToolbarItem's image with an NSHostingView containing the SwiftUI button

2. **SidebarIconTests.swift**
   - Added test for sidebar toggle button states
   - Added ViewInspector dependency for testing

3. **SidebarAnimationTests.swift**
   - Added test for hover and click effects
   - Validated the action execution on click

4. **Package.swift**
   - Added ViewInspector dependency for UI testing

### Files Created
1. **Documentation/Features/UI/SidebarIconHoverEffect.md**
   - Documented the new feature, implementation details, and benefits

### Technical Approach
1. **SwiftUI Integration with AppKit Toolbar**
   - Used NSHostingView to embed a SwiftUI view inside an NSToolbarItem
   - Maintained two-way state binding for sidebar visibility

2. **Interactive State Management**
   - Tracked hover state with `.onHover` modifier
   - Tracked press state with `.simultaneousGesture` and DragGesture
   - Used AppColors for consistent system appearance

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for button state changes
   - Action execution verification
   - Foundation for future UI testing

## Benefits
- Improved user feedback through visual interaction cues
- Consistent with modern macOS interface design guidelines
- Better indication of clickable areas in the interface
- Matches the UI pattern used elsewhere in the application

## Next Steps
- Ensure tests pass when run with the ViewInspector dependency
- Consider extending hover/click effects to other toolbar items
- Get feedback from the team on the visual design
