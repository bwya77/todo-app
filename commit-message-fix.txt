Fix drag and drop reordering for sidebar projects

This commit fixes an issue with the previous implementation that broke
the drag and drop reordering functionality for projects in the sidebar.
The changes include:

1. Reverted from Button-based implementation to direct HStack to allow
   proper interaction with drag and drop gestures
2. Restored hover state tracking for visual feedback
3. Maintained left alignment consistent with other sidebar items
4. Ensured proper background coloring for selected and hovered states

Projects now maintain the correct left alignment while fully supporting
drag and drop reordering functionality.
