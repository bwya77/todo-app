# Text Animation Implementation

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses a custom `AnimatedTextView` component that provides a simple but effective text animation when the month changes in the Upcoming view. This approach has the following advantages:

- No external dependencies
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Predictable behavior
- Works well for the month transition animation

## Future Implementation

In the future, we plan to integrate the [AnimateText library](https://github.com/jasudev/AnimateText) to enable more advanced text animations. The package has already been identified and evaluated, and the integration steps are:

1. Add the AnimateText package dependency to Package.swift:
   ```swift
   .package(url: "https://github.com/jasudev/AnimateText.git", from: "0.4.0")
   ```

2. Add the product dependency to the executable target:
   ```swift
   .product(name: "AnimateText", package: "AnimateText")
   ```

3. Update the MonthHeaderView to use AnimateText's AnimatedText component with the AtBottomTopEffect.

4. Implement extensions to provide consistent animations across the app.

## Migration Strategy

The current implementation has been designed to make the future migration to AnimateText as seamless as possible:

- The AnimatedTextView's API mirrors the expected AnimateText API
- The animation effect types are structured similarly
- The transition parameters (height, duration) are compatible

When migrating, we'll need to adjust the implementation of MonthHeaderView and any other components that use AnimatedTextView, but the change will be minimal and won't require significant refactoring of the app's structure.
