# Sidebar Icon Enhancements

## Overview

This document details the improvements made to the sidebar navigation icons to provide better visual feedback and a more consistent user experience. The icon changes enhance the application's UI by giving users clear visual cues about which section they're currently viewing.

## Icon Changes

### Inbox Icon
- When not selected: `tray`
- When selected: `tray.full.fill`
- This shows a visual representation of a full, filled inbox when selected.

### Today Icon
- When not selected: `[day].square` (e.g., `12.square`)
- When selected: `[day].square.fill` (e.g., `12.square.fill`)
- The icon dynamically updates to show the current date's number.

### Upcoming Icon
- When not selected: `calendar`
- When selected: `calendar.badge.clock`
- The addition of a badge with clock to the calendar icon indicates upcoming events.

### Filters & Labels Icon
- When not selected: `tag`
- When selected: `tag.fill`
- The filled version provides clear visual feedback when selected.

### Completed Icon
- When not selected: `checkmark.circle`
- When selected: `checkmark.circle.fill`
- The filled version provides stronger visual feedback when selected.

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a consistent pattern across all sidebar navigation items:

1. In `SidebarView.swift`, each button's Label uses a conditional SystemImage based on the selection state:
   ```swift
   Label("Section Name", systemImage: selectedViewType == .sectionType ? "filled.icon.name" : "outline.icon.name")
   ```

2. In `ViewType.swift`, the `iconName` property for each case returns the filled version of the icon:
   ```swift
   var iconName: String {
       switch self {
       case .inbox:
           return "tray.fill"
       // Other cases...
       }
   }
   ```

## Design Considerations

- **Consistent Visual Language**: All icons now follow the same pattern of using the filled version when selected and the outline version when not selected.

- **Color Coordination**: Selected items use a consistent dark blue (RGB 30,100,180) for both the icon and text, including task counters, creating a cohesive visual indicator.

- **Apple Design Guidelines**: The implementation uses standard SF Symbols with appropriate naming conventions (`icon` vs `icon.fill`).

- **Semantic Meaning**: Each icon transition strengthens the visual communication about which section is active.

- **Accessibility**: The filled icons provide better visual contrast, making it easier for users to identify the selected section.

## Testing

The icon behavior has been tested under various conditions:

- Selection/deselection of each navigation item
- Proper application of the accent color for selected items
- Consistent sizing across all icons
- Correct dynamic rendering of the day number for the Today icon

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the sidebar icons could include:

- Subtle animation during icon state transitions
- Additional visual feedback for hover states
- Customizable icon colors based on user preferences
- Badge counts for items with unread or urgent notifications
