# Project Completion Animation Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the animated project completion indicator feature.

## Feature Overview

The project completion indicator visually represents progress toward completing tasks within a project as a partial circle. The indicator uses a clockwise-filling animation that:

1. Shows project progress from 0% to the current completion percentage
2. Animates smoothly with a step-by-step progression
3. Updates dynamically when tasks are completed or added

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **CircleProgressAnimator** - A utility class that handles the animation logic
   - Controls a smooth, step-based animation
   - Manages current and target progress values
   - Can be canceled and restarted

2. **ProgressPie** - The SwiftUI component that renders the circular progress indicator
   - Uses Canvas API for efficient drawing
   - Utilizes the CircleProgressAnimator for animation

3. **ProjectCompletionIndicator** - The wrapper component that binds project data to the progress indicator
   - Calculates completion percentage from CoreData
   - Responds to changes in the data model
   - Manages lifecycle of animations

### Animation Approach

The animation uses a multi-step approach where the circle is filled in small increments:

1. When a progress change is detected, the target value is set
2. The animator calculates the required steps to reach the target
3. A series of timed incremental updates are dispatched 
4. Each step updates the displayed progress
5. The animation uses a linear timing function for smooth progression

### Optimization Considerations

1. **Performance**
   - Uses DispatchQueue with userInteractive QoS for smooth animations
   - Canvas API for efficient drawing
   - Cancellable work items to prevent animation conflicts

2. **Battery/Resource Usage**
   - Animation only occurs when progress value changes
   - Indicator update only runs when required

3. **User Experience**
   - Animation duration is kept short (0.75 seconds)
   - Uses 100 steps for a smooth visual effect

## Usage in the App

The animated progress indicator is used in two places:

1. **Sidebar Project List** - Shows project progress next to project names
2. **Project Selector** - Displays progress in the project selection modal

## Future Improvements

- Add customizable animation speed options
- Support for different animation timing functions (ease-in, ease-out)
- Customizable appearance for different contexts
