# Dynamic Today Icon Feature

## Overview

This feature enhances the user interface by using a dynamic icon for the "Today" menu item in the sidebar. The icon now displays the current day's date as a square that changes to a filled square when selected, providing clear visual feedback.

## Implementation Details

The feature was implemented with the following changes:

1. **SidebarView.swift**: 
   - Replaced the custom `CalendarDayIcon` component with a dynamic SF Symbol based on the current day
   - Updated the icon to switch between regular and filled versions based on selection state:
   ```swift
   let dayNumber = Calendar.current.component(.day, from: Date())
   Image(systemName: selectedViewType == .today ? "\(dayNumber).square.fill" : "\(dayNumber).square")
       .font(.system(size: 16)) // Slightly larger for better visibility
       .imageScale(.medium)     // Consistent scaling with other icons
   ```

2. **ViewType.swift**: 
   - Updated the `iconName` property for the `.today` case to dynamically return the current day's number with a square.fill icon
   ```swift
   let dayNumber = Calendar.current.component(.day, from: Date())
   return "\(dayNumber).square.fill"
   ```

3. **Removed Redundant Code**:
   - Removed the `CalendarDayIcon` struct as it's no longer needed

## Design Considerations

- **Visual Cohesion**: Using the day number square icon creates a more cohesive look with system icons, while still providing a clear representation of "Today"
  
- **Dynamic Content**: The icon automatically updates to show the current day, making it both functional and informative

- **Visual Feedback**: The transition between regular and filled square provides clear visual feedback when the Today section is selected

- **Consistency with System Design**: Leveraging SF Symbols' number.square format aligns with Apple's design language

## Testing

The feature has been tested for:

- Proper icon display with the correct current day number
- Correct transition between regular and filled states when selected/deselected
- Proper styling with the app's color scheme
- Appropriate scaling and alignment within the sidebar

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to this feature could include:

- Caching the day number to prevent unnecessary calendar calculations on every render
- Adding a subtle animation during the transition between regular and filled states
- Ensuring the icon updates at midnight when the day changes (if the app is running)
