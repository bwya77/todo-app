# Project Title Editing with Status Indicator

## Problem

We recently enhanced the project page to include the project status indicator next to the project title. However, this change broke our previous functionality where users could click on the project title to edit it with the cursor positioned exactly where they clicked. The issue was that when entering edit mode, the project status indicator would disappear.

## Solution

We implemented a solution that maintains the project status indicator while editing the title, ensuring a consistent user experience and better visual feedback.

### Key Changes

1. **Maintained Visual Continuity**: 
   - We kept the project status indicator visible during title editing by using an HStack layout that contains both the indicator and the text field.
   - This ensures the user always has visual feedback about the project's completion status, even during editing.

2. **Enhanced Cursor Positioning**: 
   - We updated the `EditableTextFieldWithCursorPlacement` class to better handle text field clicks within the HStack layout.
   - Added a fallback mechanism if the exact cursor position cannot be determined.

3. **Improved Layout Properties**: 
   - Added text field properties to ensure proper layout within the HStack:
     - `lineBreakMode` and `maximumNumberOfLines` to control text wrapping
     - Content hugging priority to ensure proper expansion behavior

### Implementation Details

```swift
// In the view's body:
if isEditingTitle {
    HStack(spacing: 10) {
        // Keep the project status indicator visible during editing
        ProjectCompletionIndicator(
            project: project,
            size: 20,
            viewContext: viewContext
        )
        .id("project-indicator-edit-mode-\(project.id?.uuidString ?? UUID().uuidString)")
        
        // Text field for editing
        NoSelectionTextField(text: $editedTitle, onCommit: saveProjectTitle, onStartEditing: { textField in
            // Set up click monitoring...
        })
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
    }
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
    .padding(.vertical, 8)
} else {
    // Regular display code...
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Visual Consistency**: The user interface maintains visual consistency between viewing and editing states.
2. **Enhanced User Feedback**: Users always have feedback about project completion status, even during editing.
3. **Maintained Functionality**: We preserved the precise cursor positioning feature while adding the status indicator.
4. **Better UX**: The edit mode feels like a natural extension of the display mode rather than a completely different UI state.

### Future Improvements

In the future, we could further enhance this by:
1. Adding animations for smoother transitions between viewing and editing states
2. Implementing keyboard shortcuts for editing project titles
3. Adding color indicators or other visual cues to make editing state more obvious
