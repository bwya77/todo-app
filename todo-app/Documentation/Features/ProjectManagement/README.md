## Project Management Overview

Projects help users organize tasks into logical groups. Each project can contain multiple tasks and has various properties and visualizations.

## Project Properties

Each project has:
- **Name**: The title of the project
- **Color**: Visual indicator for the project
- **Tasks**: Collection of tasks associated with the project
- **Completion Status**: Visual representation of project progress

## Project Visualizations

The app provides several visual indicators for projects:
- **Progress Circle**: Shows percentage of completed tasks
- **Task Count**: Number of active tasks in the project
- **Color Coding**: Custom colors for visual organization

## Project Interactions

Users can:
- Create new projects from the sidebar
- Edit project details (name, color)
- View all tasks within a project
- Track project progress over time
- Archive completed projects
- Filter projects by various criteria

## Project Views

The app provides several views for working with projects:
- **Project Detail View**: Shows all tasks in a selected project
- **Project List**: Shows all projects in the sidebar
- **Project Filters**: Allows sorting and filtering projects

## Best Practices

For optimal project management:
- Create projects for distinct areas of focus
- Use consistent color coding for similar projects
- Regularly review and archive completed projects
- Break larger projects into smaller, manageable projects when necessary
