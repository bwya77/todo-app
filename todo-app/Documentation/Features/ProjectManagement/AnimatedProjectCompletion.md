# Animated Project Completion Indicator

This document explains the implementation of the animated project completion indicator in the todo-app, which visually represents the percentage of completed tasks within a project.

## Overview

The project completion indicator is a circular graphic that fills clockwise as tasks within a project are completed. The amount filled corresponds to the percentage of tasks completed. For example, if a project has 4 tasks and 2 are completed, the circle will be 50% filled.

The key feature of this implementation is the smooth animation between states. When tasks are added, completed, or uncompleted, the indicator animates smoothly between the old and new states, providing clear visual feedback to the user.

## Architecture

The implementation follows a modular architecture with several key components:

1. **Project Completion Tracker**: A dedicated class that monitors changes to project tasks and calculates completion percentages
2. **Circle Progress Animator**: A utility class that handles smooth animations between progress values
3. **Canvas-based Rendering**: Efficient drawing of the indicator using SwiftUI's Canvas API
4. **CoreData Integration**: Real-time monitoring of task and project changes

### Component Details

#### ProjectCompletionTracker

This class is responsible for:
- Monitoring a specific project for changes
- Calculating the accurate completion percentage
- Publishing updates when the completion state changes

```swift
class ProjectCompletionTracker: ObservableObject {
    @Published var completionPercentage: Double = 0.0
    
    private let viewContext: NSManagedObjectContext
    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
    private var projectId: UUID?
    
    // Key methods:
    func refresh() { ... }  // Force recalculation
    func getCurrentPercentage() -> Double { ... }  // Get latest percentage
    func cleanup() { ... }  // Release resources
    
    private func updateCompletionPercentage() {
        // Direct CoreData querying for accurate counts
    }
}
```

The tracker uses direct CoreData queries rather than relying on the ViewModel to ensure we have the most up-to-date information at all times.

#### CircleProgressAnimator

This class manages the animation between progress states:

```swift
class CircleProgressAnimator: ObservableObject {
    @Published var targetProgress: Double = 0.0
    @Published var currentProgress: Double = 0.0
    
    // Animation control
    private var animationDuration: Double = 0.4
    private var animationSteps: Int = 100
    private var animationWorkItem: DispatchWorkItem?
    
    // Key methods:
    func animateTo(_ progress: Double) { ... }  // Animate to a new value
    func setProgress(_ progress: Double) { ... }  // Immediately set without animation
    func reset() { ... }  // Reset to zero
}
```

The animator creates a smooth, step-by-step animation using a series of timed updates. It's designed to be cancellable, allowing for interruption when a new target value is set before the current animation completes.

#### Canvas-based Rendering

The rendering uses SwiftUI's Canvas API for efficient drawing:

```swift
Canvas { context, size in
    // Define the center and radius of the circle
    let center = CGPoint(x: size.width/2, y: size.height/2)
    let radius = min(size.width, size.height) / 2
    
    // Create a path for the pie slice
    var path = Path()
    path.move(to: center)
    path.addArc(
        center: center, 
        radius: radius, 
        startAngle: .degrees(-90), 
        endAngle: .degrees(-90) + .degrees(360 * animator.currentProgress), 
        clockwise: false
    )
    path.closeSubpath()
    
    // Fill the path
    context.fill(path, with: .color(projectColor))
}
```

The canvas approach is more efficient than using Shape views for animation, especially for the small indicators used in this application.

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Accurate Progress Calculation

**Challenge**: Ensuring the indicator correctly reflects the actual task completion percentage, especially when tasks are added or removed.

**Solution**: The ProjectCompletionTracker performs direct CoreData queries to get accurate counts whenever changes occur. We use:

```swift
let totalCount = getTaskCount(for: project, onlyCompleted: nil)
let completedCount = getTaskCount(for: project, onlyCompleted: true)
let percentage = totalCount > 0 ? Double(completedCount) / Double(totalCount) : 0.0
```

This approach ensures we always have the most accurate percentage.

### 2. Animation Transitions

**Challenge**: Ensuring smooth animations between all states, including from partial to empty (0%).

**Solution**: 
1. Always render the progress path, even when progress is 0
2. Track the previous target value to handle 0% transitions correctly
3. Use a unique ID based on the percentage to force view recreation when needed

```swift
// Always render the path, regardless of percentage
Canvas { context, size in ... }

// Force view recreation with a unique ID
.id("progress-\(project.id?.uuidString ?? "")-\(tracker.completionPercentage)")
```

### 3. CoreData Change Detection

**Challenge**: Ensuring the UI updates immediately when tasks are completed or added.

**Solution**: Use both NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange notifications and a debounced timer:

```swift
// Set up notification observer for context changes
NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange, object: viewContext)
    .debounce(for: .milliseconds(100), scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [weak self] _ in
        self?.updateCompletionPercentage()
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

### 4. Resource Management

**Challenge**: Preventing memory leaks from observers and cancellables.

**Solution**: Proper cleanup in onDisappear and deinit:

```swift
.onDisappear {
    tracker.cleanup()
}

// In the tracker
func cleanup() {
    cancellables.removeAll()
}
```

## Animation Details

The animation follows these steps:

1. **Initial State**: The progress indicator starts at the current completion percentage.

2. **Event Trigger**: A task is added, completed, or uncompleted, changing the project's completion percentage.

3. **Calculation**: The ProjectCompletionTracker calculates the new percentage and publishes the change.

4. **Animation Setup**: The CircleProgressAnimator receives the new target value and sets up a series of incremental steps.

5. **Step Animation**: The animator executes approximately 100 tiny steps over 0.4 seconds, incrementally updating the `currentProgress` property.

6. **Rendering**: Each progress update triggers a redraw of the canvas, creating the illusion of smooth animation.

7. **Cancellation Handling**: If another change occurs during animation, the current animation is canceled, and a new one starts from the current progress value.

## Best Practices Applied

The implementation follows several best practices:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear, single responsibility
- **Reactive Programming**: Using Combine for event-based updates
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of resources and cancellables
- **Efficiency**: Canvas-based rendering instead of Shape views for better performance
- **Direct Database Access**: Direct CoreData queries for accurate data
- **Cancellable Operations**: All long-running operations can be interrupted
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive debug logging and a test component

## Testing

The implementation includes a test component (`AnimatedProgressIndicatorTest.swift`) that allows developers to:

1. Manually test the animation using a slider and preset buttons
2. Test with real CoreData by creating a test project
3. Add and complete tasks to see the animation in action
4. View debugging information about the expected and actual percentages

## Usage

The ProjectCompletionIndicator is used in two places:

1. **Sidebar**: Showing project progress next to project names
2. **Project Selector**: Displaying progress in the project selection modal

In both cases, the implementation is consistent, providing a unified experience throughout the application.

## Conclusion

The animated project completion indicator provides clear visual feedback about project progress. By using a custom animation system with direct CoreData monitoring, we've created a responsive, efficient, and visually appealing component that enhances the user experience.

The implementation is robust against edge cases like empty projects, rapid changes, and all transition types (0% → 50%, 50% → 100%, 100% → 50%, 50% → 0%).
