# Completed Tasks Animation and Logging

## Overview

This feature enhances the user experience when completing tasks in Project views by:

1. Keeping completed tasks in place for 2 seconds after being marked as complete
2. Smoothly animating them to a collapsible "logged items" section
3. Providing a toggle to show/hide completed tasks

## Implementation Details

### Core Data Model Changes

- Added `logged` Boolean attribute to the `Item` entity to track whether a completed task has been moved to the logged section
- Added `completionDate` Date attribute to track when a task was completed

### Animation Flow

The animation uses a robust combination of state tracking and SwiftUI animations:

1. When tasks are toggled, a counter state variable increments to trigger animations
2. Custom asymmetric transitions are used for different task movements:
   - Tasks being completed: fade out and move down
   - Tasks being uncompleted: fade in and move up from the logged section 
3. The `taskUpdateCounter` variable works around the limitation that `FetchedResults<Item>` doesn't conform to `Equatable`

### Task Completion Flow

1. When a user marks a task as complete:
   - The `completed` flag is set to true
   - The `completionDate` is set to the current date
   - The task remains visible in the main task list for 2 seconds
   
2. After the 2-second delay:
   - The `logged` flag is set to true
   - The task animates to the logged items section
   - If this is the first logged task, the "Show logged items" toggle appears (collapsed by default)
   - The toggle must be explicitly clicked to expand and view logged tasks

### UI Components

- `LoggedItemsToggle` - A custom toggle component that displays either "Show logged items" or "Hide logged items" text with a count of logged tasks
- The logged items section can be expanded/collapsed by clicking on the toggle

### Architecture Improvements

- Separated fetch requests for active and logged tasks to improve performance and simplify the UI logic
- Added proper cleanup for timers when views appear/disappear to prevent memory leaks
- Implemented data consistency checks to handle edge cases (e.g., app closed before timer fired)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:

1. Add customizable delay time in app settings
2. Implement batch actions for logged tasks (delete all, restore all)
3. Add visual indicators during the 2-second countdown before logging
4. Allow dragging tasks between active and logged sections

## Design Decisions

- Used a timer-based approach rather than animation keyframes to ensure the CoreData model state changes at the correct time
- Made logged tasks slightly transparent (0.7 opacity) to visually distinguish them from active tasks
- Added smooth transitions using SwiftUI's animation API to make the user experience more fluid
- Removed dividers between sections for a cleaner, more minimal UI appearance
- Keep logged items collapsed by default to avoid disrupting the user's workflow
- Used asymmetric transitions for natural-feeling animations in both directions

## Testing Considerations

To test this feature:
1. Complete a task and verify it stays in place for 2 seconds
2. Verify it moves to the logged section after the delay
3. Test toggling the logged items visibility
4. Verify uncompleting a logged task brings it back to the active section immediately
5. Test app closure during the 2-second window to ensure proper task state recovery
