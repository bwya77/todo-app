# Inbox Task Reordering Implementation

## Overview

This feature enhances the Inbox view to support drag-and-reorder functionality for tasks, making it consistent with the existing Project view implementation. It provides a smooth, animated reordering experience for users managing their unassigned tasks.

## Implementation Details

The Inbox tasks are now displayed as a flat list without section headers, exactly like Project tasks. This provides a more intuitive and consistent interface across the app.

### Key Changes:

1. **Flat List Display**: Removed the "No Project" section header, displaying Inbox tasks in a single flat list.

2. **Unified Task View**: Uses the same `UnifiedTaskListView` component as the Project view.

3. **Consistent Drag & Drop**: Implements the same smooth drag-and-drop animations and behavior as the Project view.

4. **Display Order Management**: Added dedicated logic for managing Inbox task display order.

## Code Changes

Major changes were made to the following components:

1. **ReorderableTaskListView**:
   - Added special handling for Inbox view to match Project view
   - Removed groupBy behavior for Inbox tasks

2. **InitializeDisplayOrderMigration**:
   - Added `initializeInboxDisplayOrder` method for managing Inbox task ordering
   - Ensures proper spacing for new tasks (using 10-point increments)

3. **TaskReordering**:
   - Modified `resetTaskOrder` to handle Inbox tasks independently

## Testing

To test this feature:

1. Create several tasks in the Inbox
2. Verify they can be dragged and reordered with smooth animations
3. Restart the app and confirm the order is maintained
4. Try dragging tasks to different positions and verify proper visual feedback

## Benefits

- **Improved Consistency**: Users now have the same experience managing tasks in both Inbox and Projects
- **Better Usability**: Direct manipulation of task order without folder/section headers
- **Maintainability**: Shared code logic for both views reduces duplication

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for future updates:

- Add drag-and-drop between Inbox and Projects
- Implement multiple task selection for batch reordering
- Support keyboard shortcuts for reordering
