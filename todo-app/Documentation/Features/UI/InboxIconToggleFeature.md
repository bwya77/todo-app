# Inbox Icon Toggle Feature

## Overview

This feature enhances the user interface by dynamically changing the Inbox icon when a user clicks on it. The icon transitions from "tray" to "tray.fill" when the Inbox is selected, providing clear visual feedback to users.

## Implementation Details

The feature was implemented with the following changes:

1. **SidebarView.swift**: Updated the Label component in the Inbox button to conditionally display different system icons based on selection state:
   ```swift
   Label("Inbox", systemImage: selectedViewType == .inbox ? "tray.fill" : "tray")
   ```

2. **ViewType.swift**: Updated the `iconName` property for the `.inbox` case to return "tray.fill" to ensure consistency across the app when the Inbox is referenced or displayed in other views.

## Design Considerations

- **Visual Feedback**: The icon change provides immediate visual feedback to the user about which section they're currently viewing.

- **Consistency**: Both the sidebar and any other components that reference the ViewType's iconName will now show the correct icon state.

- **Performance**: The implementation uses conditional rendering with a simple ternary operator, which is efficient and doesn't introduce any performance overhead.

## Testing

The feature has been tested for:

- Proper icon display when navigating to and from the Inbox
- Correct color application based on selection state
- Consistent rendering across different window sizes

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to this feature could include:

- Adding subtle animation during the icon transition
- Extending similar behavior to other navigation items
- Persisting the selection state across app restarts
