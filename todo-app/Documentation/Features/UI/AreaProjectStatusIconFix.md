# Area Project Status Icon Fix

## Issue
In the Areas view, projects were displayed with a solid color circle indicator instead of the proper project status indicator that shows completion status, which is used in other parts of the application.

## Solution
Modified the project row rendering in the AreaDetailView to use the ProjectCompletionIndicator component instead of a simple colored circle.

This ensures consistent representation of project status across the entire application and provides users with visual feedback about project completion directly from the Areas view.

## Implementation
1. Replaced the simple Circle with ProjectCompletionIndicator in the AreaDetailView
2. Added proper ID keys to ensure the indicators update properly when projects change
3. Added Combine import to support the reactive completion tracking
