# Networking

This directory will contain networking-related code for the application. This includes API clients, network services, and related utilities.

## Naming Conventions

- API clients: `[Service]APIClient.swift`
- Network services: `[Service]NetworkService.swift`
- Request/Response models: `[Service][Request/Response].swift`

## Implementation Notes

- All network requests should be asynchronous and cancellable.
- Error handling should be robust with specific error types.
- Response parsing should be handled consistently.
- Authentication and authorization should be managed securely.

## Planned Components

- `NetworkService.swift`: Base networking service with shared functionality
- `APIError.swift`: Custom error types for API responses
- `AuthenticationService.swift`: Service for handling authentication
- `SyncService.swift`: Service for syncing local data with remote servers
