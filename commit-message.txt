Left-align projects in sidebar to match other items

This commit improves the sidebar UI consistency by making projects align
to the left like all other sidebar items. Changes include:

1. Refactored ReorderableProjectList to use the same CustomSidebarButtonStyle
   as other sidebar items
2. Removed redundant horizontal padding that was pushing projects to the right
3. Simplified the project row layout to match the style of other sidebar items
4. Maintained drag and drop reordering functionality
5. Removed unused state variables and helper functions

The projects now visually align perfectly with other sidebar items like
Inbox, Today, etc., creating a more consistent and polished UI experience.
