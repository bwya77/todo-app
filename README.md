## Features

### Project Selection Color
The Selection color for projects is based on the project color. Here you can see Health was chosen as red so the project status icon is red and the Add Task button is red. When you check an item as complete, the checkbox also follows the project color.

### Project Logged Tasks
When a task is completed, it will transition to the bottom of the project view. You are able to view logged items and unlog them if needed.

### Month/Year Animation

The Upcoming view features elegant month and year transitions with custom animations:
- Smaller, more minimal display of month and year below the header
- Month in semibold font and year in thin font for improved visual hierarchy
- Smooth bottom-to-top transition animation when changing months
- The animation treats both month and year as a single unit for a cohesive look
