# Improved Drag and Drop Experience

## Key Enhancements

1. **Spring Animations**
   - Replaced linear/ease animations with spring animations
   - Used shorter, snappier springs with appropriate response/damping values:
   ```swift
   private let expandAnimation = Animation.spring(response: 0.2, dampingFraction: 0.7)
   private let dragAnimation = Animation.spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.6)
   ```

2. **Consolidated Drag State Management**
   - Added a `DragState` struct to manage all drag-related state in one place
   - Provides a clean `reset()` method to ensure complete cleanup after operations
   - Will make future modifications easier with centralized state

3. **Interactive Animation Improvements**
   - Applied spring animations to area expand/collapse operations
   - Made toggling areas feel more responsive and natural
   - Added proper animation during drag operations

4. **Animation Consistency**
   - Now matches the same feel as the task reordering experience
   - Uses consistent animation timing for visual coherence

## Technical Implementation

The new design follows modern Apple HIG patterns:

1. Quick response to user input (~0.2-0.3s response time)
2. Natural-feeling physics with spring animations
3. Consistent animation styles across the app
4. Improved state management for more reliable animation behavior

These changes make the drag and drop operations feel more like a native Apple experience with the same polish and responsiveness users expect from modern macOS applications.
