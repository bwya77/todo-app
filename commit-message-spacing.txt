Improve vertical spacing in sidebar projects

This commit enhances the visual separation in the sidebar by:

1. Adding a 16-point spacer between the "Completed" item and the first project
2. Adding 6-point spacing between individual projects in the list

These spacing adjustments improve readability and create a clearer
visual hierarchy in the sidebar, making it easier to distinguish between
different project items while maintaining the left alignment.
