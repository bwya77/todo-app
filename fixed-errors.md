# Fixed Compiler Errors

## Issues Fixed
1. Added missing `isDraggingFromAreaToNoArea` binding to the `EmptySpaceDropDelegate` struct:
   - Added the binding parameter to the struct definition
   - Passed the binding when creating the delegate instance

2. The error was occurring because:
   - We were using `isDraggingFromAreaToNoArea` inside `EmptySpaceDropDelegate` 
   - But we hadn't properly declared it as a binding in the struct
   - We also weren't passing it when creating the delegate instance

3. Complete fix:
   ```swift
   // Added binding to struct definition
   struct EmptySpaceDropDelegate: DropDelegate {
       @Binding var draggedProject: Project?
       @Binding var isDraggingOver: UUID?
       @Binding var isHoveringOverNoAreaSection: Bool
       @Binding var isDraggingFromAreaToNoArea: Bool  // Added this line
       var removeFromAreaAction: (Project) -> Void
       
       // ... rest of the implementation
   }
   
   // Updated delegation creation with new binding
   .onDrop(of: [.text], delegate: EmptySpaceDropDelegate(
       draggedProject: $draggedProject,
       isDraggingOver: $isDraggingOver,
       isHoveringOverNoAreaSection: $isHoveringOverNoAreaSection,
       isDraggingFromAreaToNoArea: $isDraggingFromAreaToNoArea,  // Added this line
       removeFromAreaAction: { project in
           assignProjectToArea(project: project, area: nil)
       }
   ))
   ```

The application should now compile without errors and properly display the box highlighting when dragging projects between areas.
