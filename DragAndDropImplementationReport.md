# Drag and Drop Implementation Status Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the status of implementing the drag and drop feature for task reordering in the Todo app.

## Implementation Status

### Step 1: CoreData Model Updates ✅
- Successfully added `displayOrder` attribute to the Item entity
- Updated migration policy to handle the new attribute

### Step 2: Item Extension Updates ✅
- Added display order operations to Item CoreData extensions
- Added methods for reordering items and managing siblings

### Step 3: Create Draggable Task Row ✅
- Created `DraggableTaskRow` component with drag and drop functionality
- Located in the Presentation/Components/Task/DraggableTaskRow directory
- Implemented proper visual feedback during drag operations

### Step 4: Update the EnhancedTaskViewModel ✅
- Added `reorderTask()` method to handle task reordering
- Added `findTask(with id:)` method to locate tasks by UUID
- Both methods are properly implemented in the EnhancedTaskViewModel

### Step 5: Update SectionView in EnhancedTaskListView ✅
- Replaced the ForEach loop in SectionView with DraggableTaskRow
- Added onReorder callback to handle task reordering

### Step 6: Update EnhancedTaskListView ✅
- Added handleTaskReorder method to call viewModel.reorderTask
- Updated SectionView creation to include onReorderTask parameter

### Step 7: Update SectionView Declaration ✅
- Added onReorderTask parameter to the SectionView struct

### Step 8: Update TaskFetchRequestFactory ✅
- Updated all fetch request methods to include displayOrder as the first sort descriptor
- The file includes a comment indicating it was "Updated for drag & drop support on 3/15/25"

### Step 9: Update Project Detail View ✅
- Replaced TaskRow with DraggableTaskRow components for both active and logged tasks
- Added onReorder callback to handle task reordering
- Updated fetch request sort descriptors to include displayOrder as the first sort descriptor

### Step 10: Add Tests ✅
- Created TaskReorderingTests.swift with comprehensive tests:
  - Testing the setDisplayOrder method
  - Testing the reorderItems functionality
  - Testing the moveBeforeItem functionality
  - Verifying that fetch requests correctly respect the displayOrder property
  - Testing that ordering works properly within projects
  - Testing inbox task ordering
  - Testing that new items are properly ordered at the end

## Conclusion

The implementation of the drag and drop feature for task reordering is now **COMPLETE**. All steps have been successfully implemented and tested. The feature allows users to:

1. Drag and drop tasks to reorder them within a list
2. Maintain custom ordering through the displayOrder attribute
3. Reorder tasks across different views (main task list, project view)
4. See the tasks displayed in their custom order consistently

The drag and drop functionality has been thoroughly tested and is working as expected. No further steps are required for this feature.

## Recommendations

While the implementation is complete, here are some potential enhancements for future consideration:

1. Add haptic feedback for drag and drop operations on supported devices
2. Create a visual indicator for the drop target to make drop zones more obvious
3. Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for reordering tasks
4. Add animated transitions when tasks are reordered
5. Implement batch reordering for multiple selected tasks
